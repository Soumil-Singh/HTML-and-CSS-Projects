<h1>Solar System</h1>

<p>The Solar System[a] is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects
 that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.[b] Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly,
 the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, such as dwarf 
planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons,
 two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Arial">Sun</h3>

<p>The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. 
Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses) produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, 
making it a main-sequence star.
This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic 
radiation peaking in visible light.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:courier">Inner Solar System</h3>

<p>The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.
Composed mainly of silicates and metals, the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively 
close to the Sun;
 the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. 
This region is also within the frost line, 
which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Times New Roman">Outer Solar System</h3>

<p>The outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons. 
The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. 
Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain 
a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner
 Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.</p>
